# Statistics and Probability Project

Welcome to my Statistics and Probability project repository. This project encompasses various fundamental topics in statistics and probability. Each folder contains relevant materials, including Excel files and raw data sheets, which can be viewed directly on GitHub.

## Table of Contents

1. [Confidence Interval](#confidence-interval)
2. [Descriptive Statistics](#descriptive-statistics)
3. [Hypothesis Testing](#hypothesis-testing)
4. [Regression Analysis](#regression-analysis)

## Confidence Interval

### Description
This folder includes materials related to the concept of confidence intervals, which are used to estimate the range within which a population parameter lies based on a sample statistic.

### Contents
- `confidence_interval.xlsx`: An Excel file containing data and calculations for various confidence interval examples.
- `sheet1.csv`: The raw data used in the Excel file, saved separately for easy viewing.

### Key Topics
- Confidence Level
- Margin of Error
- Calculation of Confidence Intervals for different distributions

## Descriptive Statistics

### Description
This folder covers descriptive statistics, which summarize and describe the main features of a dataset.

### Contents
- `descriptive_statistics.xlsx`: An Excel file with data and summary statistics such as mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation.
- `sheet1.csv`: The raw data used in the Excel file, saved separately for easy viewing.

### Key Topics
- Measures of Central Tendency
- Measures of Dispersion
- Data Visualization Techniques

## Hypothesis Testing

### Description
This folder contains resources on hypothesis testing, a method used to make inferences or draw conclusions about a population based on sample data.

### Contents
- `hypothesis_testing.xlsx`: An Excel file with data and examples of different hypothesis tests.
- `sheet1.csv`: The raw data used in the Excel file, saved separately for easy viewing.

### Key Topics
- Null and Alternative Hypotheses
- Type I and Type II Errors
- p-Values and Significance Levels
- Various Statistical Tests (t-test, chi-square test, etc.)

## Regression Analysis

### Description
This folder focuses on regression analysis, a statistical technique used to model and analyze relationships between variables.

### Contents
- `regression_analysis.xlsx`: An Excel file containing data and regression analysis examples.
- `sheet1.csv`: The raw data used in the Excel file, saved separately for easy viewing.

### Key Topics
- Simple Linear Regression
- Multiple Regression
- Interpretation of Regression Coefficients
- Model Assumptions and Diagnostics

## Usage

Each folder contains an Excel file with detailed calculations and analyses. The raw data files are saved separately in CSV format for easy access and review on GitHub. You can explore these files to understand the methodologies and applications of various statistical techniques.
