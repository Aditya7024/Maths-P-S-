Practical example. Hypothesis testing.,,,,,,,,,,,
Homework,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
Background:,"You are given the same dataset. We have also created two new worksheets: 'White' (containing only employees that are indicated as white) and 'Nonwhite' (Asian, Black or African American, Hispanic, Two or more races). ",,,,,,,,,,
,"With the help of the new worksheets, it will be easier for you to calculate sample statistics.",,,,,,,,,,
Task 1:,"Using the same methodology as in the lecture, find if there is pay gap based on race.",,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
Overall,n,Mean,Sample variance,Pooled variance,T-score,p-value,,,,,
White,112," $67,323.10 "," $1,13,67,28,018.03 "," $1,16,80,51,481.95 ",0.66,0.51,,,,,
Nonwhite,62," $70,917.26 "," $1,22,50,49,916.30 ",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,0
There is no pay gap based on race.The results is insignificant,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
Task 2:,Is there gender/racial discrimination in the production department,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
Overall,n,Mean,Sample variance,Pooled variance,T-score,p-value,,,,,
Male,76, $ 72300.53 ," $1,06,71,35,890.57 "," $1,05,81,86,547.75 ",1.34,0.182,,,,,
Female,98, $ 65736.91 ," $1,05,12,66,952.79 ",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
cant reject the null hypothesis hence need more statistical evidence to tell that there is gender wage gap in the firm,,,,,,,,,,,
